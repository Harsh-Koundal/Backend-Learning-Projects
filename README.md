# Backend-Learning-Projects

A curated collection of **small, focused backend projects** built to strengthen core backend engineering skills through **hands-on implementation**.

This repository is not about building large products.  
It is about **understanding backend fundamentals deeply** by solving problems in isolation and applying best practices incrementally.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Build strong fundamentals in **backend development**
- Practice **real-world backend concepts** in small, manageable projects
- Improve **API design, data handling, and system reliability**
- Develop a habit of writing **clean, maintainable backend code**
- Prepare for **SDE-I backend / full-stack roles**

Each project focuses on **one or two backend concepts**, rather than trying to do everything at once.

## 🧠 What This Repository Focuses On

- REST API design & best practices  
- Request validation & error handling  
- Authentication & authorization basics  
- Database modeling & query optimization  
- Backend workflows & business logic  
- Performance considerations  
- Code structure & scalability fundamentals  

No frontend-heavy projects.  
No unnecessary UI complexity.
